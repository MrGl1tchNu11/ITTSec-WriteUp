### 🔍 How To Solve

In that challenge, we were given a website containing a simple game where the player had only 2 damage points and was instructed to attack the boss.

And when I clicked the button labeled “Attack the Boss!”, I was instantly defeated. No surprise there the boss had a full 50/50 HP, and with only 2 damage per hit, it was impossible to win through normal means.

Then I spotted something interesting the website’s URL included a query parameter: ?damage=2. That got me thinking what if I changed it to ?damage=9999

And it worked! After changing the value to 999, I defeated the boss instantly and bingo, the flag was mine.
