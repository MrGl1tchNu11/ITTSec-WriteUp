### 🔍 How To Solve

In the Kill The Boss V2 challenge, we were given a website with the same appearance as Kill The Boss V1, so I won’t bother showing the image again lol..

Okay, back to the topic since there was no query like in V1, I started checking the Network tab and found something interesting: it was sending a request parameter in Base64.

After decoding the Base64, I got the text “damage=2”.

That gave me a clear idea of where this was going, so I proceeded to encode the text “damage=999” into Base64.

Since this was part of the body data that needed to be replaced, the options were to use Curl or Burpsuite. But I was too lazy to open Burp ;v so I just used Curl instead.

And after checking Boom! Bingo! I got the flag
