### 🔍 How To Solve

In this challenge, we were given a company landing page website. The navbar had three items: “Home,” “About Us,” and “Box.” At first glance, nothing seemed particularly interesting.

But after inspecting the source code, I noticed something suspicious—code that resembled a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

I tried accessing /etc/passwd to test it, since flags are sometimes placed there, but didn’t find the flag. Still, I was right it was LFI.

I kept searching for valid paths but didn’t find anything. Then I tried flag.php, and the page turned completely white without any error. Was it loaded but the code stored inside PHP?

So I checked using a PHP filter. The payload I used was:
?page=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=flag.php

I got the base64 I wanted, decoded it

And Bingo
